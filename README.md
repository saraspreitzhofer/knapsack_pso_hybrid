# The knapsack problem: PSO and Hybrid Algorithm

This notebook includes the implementation of the particle swarm optimization for the one-, multi-, and multiple multidimensional 0/1 knapsack problem. Moreover, to improve the runtime and maximum profit, a hybrid algorithm is created, combining the advantages of the PSO and the GA from https://github.com/saraspreitzhofer/knapsack_greedy_genetic.
